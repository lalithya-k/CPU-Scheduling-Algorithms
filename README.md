# CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms in Python. CPU scheduling is a fundamental concept in operating systems, determining the order in which processes are executed on the CPU.

## Algorithms Included

1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
3. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
4. Longest Job First (LJF)
5. Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)
6. Priority Scheduling nonpreemptive
7. Priority Sheduling preemptive
8. Round Robin (RR) 

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python scripts.
4. Choose the algorithm you want to run and execute its corresponding script.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions, if any, to provide input data.
6. View the output, which typically includes the order of process execution and other relevant metrics.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements or additional algorithms to add, feel free to open a pull request.
